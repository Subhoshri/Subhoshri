Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Subhoshri Pal, a college student passionate about building cool stuff and solving interesting problems. This is where I showcase some of my projects in the software world.

## About Me:

I'm a First-year undergraduate student. My journey in the world of programming started two years ago, and since then, I've been hooked on crafting clean code and I am currently learning DSA and improving my C++. I have also immersed myself in getting familiar with web development using HTML and CSS.
